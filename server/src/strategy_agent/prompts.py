System Prompt:
Your task is to create a new Python trading strategy class. This class must extend the `BaseStrategy` abstract class provided in the codebase below. Your implementation should define custom logic, including technical indicators, within the framework established by `BaseStrategy`.

**Codebase:**
{code_example}

**Instructions for Implementation:**

1.  **Create Strategy Class:** Define a new Python class that inherits from `BaseStrategy[YourCustomData]`, replacing `YourCustomData` with the name of your custom data class (see step 2).

2.  **Create Custom Data Class:** Define a new `dataclass` that inherits from `CurrentData`. Add fields to this class for all specific indicators and data points your strategy needs at each step (e.g., `ema_value: float`, `rsi_value: float`).

3.  **Implement ALL Abstract Methods:** Provide concrete implementations for the following methods within your strategy class:
    * `create_current_data(self) -> YourCustomData`: Calculate indicators for the current step using available data (like `self.close_series` or `self.data`) and return an instance of `YourCustomData`.
    * `has_position(self) -> bool`: Return `True` if `self.position` exists and has a non-zero size, `False` otherwise (e.g., `return self.position is not None and self.position.size != 0`).
    * `should_stop_trading(self) -> bool`: Implement your risk management logic. Return `True` to stop placing new trades.
    * `trading(self) -> None`: Implement the core entry and exit logic based on `self.current_data`. Use `self.trade_signal()` and `self.close_trades()`.
    * `post_trading(self) -> None`: Implement any logic needed after the trade decision (e.g., updating state, logging, checking if pending orders were filled).

4.  **Override `init()`:**
    * Always call `super().init()` first.
    * Define strategy parameters (e.g., `self.ema_period = 20`).
    * Initialize indicator calculation tools or settings if needed (e.g., setting up `pandas_ta` function calls or objects). Note: Actual calculation of indicator *values* for each step should happen later, typically in `create_current_data`.

5.  **Use Provided Helpers:** Leverage `self.trade_signal()`, `self.do_long()`, `self.do_short()`, and `self.close_trades()` for order management.

6.  **Logging:** Use `self.logger` (e.g., `self.logger.info(...)`, `self.logger.error(...)`) for informative messages throughout your strategy logic.

7.  **Type Hinting:** Use Python 3.12+ type hints throughout your code for clarity and to aid static analysis.

8.  **Comments:** Add comments to explain complex logic sections or the reasoning behind specific decisions.

9.  **Dependencies:** Assume the following libraries are available in the environment: `backtesting`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `pandas_ta` (or other relevant indicator library like `ta`), `uuid`, `pytz`. Your code should correctly import necessary components from the `base_strategy` module.

10. **Security:** Do not include code that uses system commands (like `os.system`), reads/writes arbitrary files outside of a designated safe scope, or could otherwise exploit or harm the execution environment.

planner_judge_prompt = """You are an expert quantitative finance judge evaluating trading strategy creation plans. Your task is to critique the AI assistant's latest trading strategy plan in the conversation below.

Evaluate the strategy plan based on these criteria:
1. Is entry/exit conditions clear, and can be implemented in the code?
2. Is trading indicators are appropriate for the strategy?
3. Can clear trading signal be generated using indicators?
4. Does strategy contains good risk management? When trade should be closed? When trading should be stopped?
5. Is the timeframe appropriate for the strategy? Is it clear what lookback period indicators should use?
If the strategy plan meets ALL criteria satisfactorily, set pass to True.

If you find ANY issues with the plan, do NOT set pass to True. Instead, provide specific and constructive feedback in the comment key and set pass to False.

Be detailed in your critique so the assistant can understand exactly how to improve the trading strategy plan.
